### **Steps for SSH Connection to Metasploitable:**

**1. Verify SSH Service on Metasploitable:**
Before attempting an SSH connection, ensure the SSH service is running on **Metasploitable**. You can use **Nmap** to verify that the service is active on port **22**:

```bash
nmap -sV -p 22 <Metasploitable_IP>
```

- Replace **`<Metasploitable_IP>`** with the actual IP address of the **Metasploitable** machine you are targeting.

**2. Attempt SSH Connection to Metasploitable:**

Now, try to connect to **Metasploitable** via SSH using the following command:

```bash
ssh msfadmin@<Metasploitable_IP>
```

This should work for most cases, but if you encounter issues with SSH algorithms, proceed to the next step.

**3. Alternative SSH Command (If Algorithms Mismatch):**

Sometimes, **Kali** and **Metasploitable** might use different SSH algorithms, causing the connection to fail. If this happens, try the following SSH command to force compatibility:

```bash
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa msfadmin@<Metasploitable_IP>
```

This option ensures that the SSH connection uses the **`ssh-rsa`** algorithm, which may resolve compatibility issues between Kali and Metasploitable.

**4. Verify the Connection:**

If the SSH connection is successful, you will be logged into the **Metasploitable** terminal, where you can proceed with further tasks as required for the assignment.
